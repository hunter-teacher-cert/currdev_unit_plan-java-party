Java Unit Plan
By Alexander Moore
Methods II
Hunter College Advanced Certificate Program
10-5-21 

Objective:  The student will develop skills necessary to do basic Java programming.  They will create programs demonstrating understanding of variables, assignments, concatenation, input, output, methods, iteration, selection, sequencing, parameters, arguments, classes, constructors, class methods, instance variables, and objects.
Rationale:  The BJC curriculum, which was developed by the University of California at Berkeley, is a superb way of engaging students in the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum.  One shortcoming I have noticed in my teaching is the inadequate attention paid to developing text-based programming skills, which are helpful for preparing students to be successful on the multiple choice AP Exam questions in AP pseudocode.  My solution to this is to teach a five-week mini unit on the basics of Java programming.

Note:  In each case, as long as these minimum requirements are met, students are encouraged to add their own creative elements for extra credit.

Week 1 - Lab 1:  Hello World
Textbook Reading
Minimum Requirements:  The program says, “Hello World!”
Topics:  
-Setting up the JDK.
-Setting up the IDE
-Introduction to Java syntax

Week 2 - Lab 2:  Calculator
Textbook Reading
Minimum Requirements:  The program asks for at least one string, at least one int, at least one char, and at least one float.  Output is produced using these values.  
-Primitive types
-Variables
-Assignment
-Concatenation
-Input and Output

Week 3 - Lab 3:  Dice
Textbook Reading
Minimum Requirements:  The program allows the user to roll two six-sided dice.  The AI also rolls two six-sided dice.  The winner gets one victory point.  The first player to earn three victory points is the Dice Champion!
-Methods
-Iteration
-Selection
-Sequencing
-Arguments
-Parameters

Week 4- Lab 4:  Maze
Textbook Reading
Minimum Requirements:  The program generates a maze, which does not need to be created randomly.  The program must include at least one class, at least one constructor, at least one class method, at least one instance variable, and at least one object.  The user can control a player and try to move the player safely from the beginning of the maze to the end of the maze.
-Classes
-Constructors
-Class Methods
-Instance Variables
-Objects

Week 5- Lab 5:  Creative Project  
Textbook Reading
Minimum Requirements:  This program can be of any type desired by the programmer as long as it demonstrates understanding of at least ten of the topics listed above.
-At least ten topics of the programmer’s choice
