## General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
Disclaimer:  All assignments listed here are optional enrichment activities.  Students do not need to master this material to be successful on our AP Exam.
Description:  AP Computer Science A - Lite Version is a truncated, simplified version of the AP Computer Science A curriculum that interested students will have the chance to complete within our AP Computer Science Principles curriculum.  Participating students will still be responsible for mastering all content in AP Computer Science Principles, and they will take the AP Computer Science Principles Exam at the end of the course.  Students completing the AP Computer Science A Lite labs may substitute AP CS A lab grades for AP CSP lab grades as desired.
Objective:  The student will develop skills necessary to do basic Java programming.  They will create programs demonstrating understanding of variables, assignments, concatenation, input, output, methods, iteration, selection, sequencing, parameters, arguments, classes, constructors, class methods, instance variables, and objects.
Additional Support:  Code skeletons can be made available to students as desired.  Tutoring support will also be available.
Flexibility:  Students are encouraged to work on the standard versions of the assignments below, which are already challenging for high school students.  There are also multiple advanced options for extra credit.
Better Together:  Students are encouraged to work together in pairs on assignments, but they may also work independently.

## Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)
Rationale:  The BJC curriculum, which was developed by the University of California at Berkeley, is a superb way of engaging students in the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum.  Having said this, some students in the course are interested in pursuing computer science in college or career and are eager to pursue a more accelerated course of study in text-based programming.  AP Computer Science A Lite aims to support these students.

## Standards Referenced
(select one of the standards sets reviewed in class (CSTA, NY, MA, RI), include a link and a brief explanation as to why you selected that set)
http://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-and-digital-fluency-learning-standards**
I selected The New York State Computer Science and Digital Fluency Standards because I am teaching computer science in a public school in New York City, and the work we are doing is aligned with State expectation in terms of content and skills.  We will be building on the Computational Thinking strand.

## Tools Used
(include programming language(s), specific programs/environments, and other tools (digital or otherwise) if necessary)
Instructions:  Some students will choose to complete optional labs using the Java programming language.  If this describes you, you will want to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  Three of many possibilities are repl.it, Atom, and Notepad++.  For beginning programmers, I would recommend the Web based repl.it.  It requires minimal setup (no JDK or JVM required), has a built in terminal, and is platform independent.  
1)  Go here:  https://replit.com/  
2)  Create a free account.
3)  Click on +Create repl.
4)  Select Java under the Template menu.
5)  Give your repl (collection of projects) a name of your choice.
6)  Click on + Create repl.
7)  Click on the Shell tab on the right.
8)  Type javac Main.java
9)  Type java Main
10)  Congratulations!  You have just written, compiled, and run your first Java program.
Tips:  
-You must always compile your project to Java byte code before running it.  You can compile by typing javac fileName.java
-You can run your program by typing java fileName
-You can see all of the directories and files in the current directory by typing dir in the shell.
-You can change your current directory by typing the full path or typing the name of the directory to go into next, such as cd project1
-If you choose to link your project to GitHub, you can push your project by going to version control.  
-Remember that the name of your class must match the name of your .java file.
-Compile and run frequently.  It will make debugging much easier.
-When you debug, check first for missing semicolons, parentheses, commas, and curly braces.  If it is not coded perfectly, it will neither compile nor run successfully.  Now you know why beginning programmers often start with block-based languages!

## Lessons
Total length: 5 months (taught as a supplement to the standard curriculum over the course of the school year)

(list each lesson with main topic(s))

Standard:  9-12.CT.4 Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation
Java Lab 1 - October:  ASCII Art  
Textbook Reading:  pp. 7-20
AP CSA Lite Lab 1 - Standard:  The program displays the student’s name in ASCII art on multiple lines.    ASCII art is a larger image made up of smaller printable characters that can be created with a computer keyboard.
AP CSA Lite Lab 1 - Advanced Option 1 (+20 points):  The program displays a recognizable picture in ASCII art.
AP CSA Lite Lab 1 - Advanced Option 2 (+20 points):  The program outputs characters that give the appearance of crude animation.
Topics:  
-Setting up the IDE
-Running and compiling
-Debugging
-Introduction to Java syntax
Optional Supports:  
-Students may receive support in tutoring on Mondays and Thursdays from 3:30-4:30 in 131 or on Zoom at URL
-Students may email the teacher to request a code skeleton for added support.

Standard:  9-12.CT.4 Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation
Java Lab 2 - November:  Calculator
Textbook Reading:  pp. 21- 60
AP CSA Lite Lab 2 - Standard:  The program asks for at least one string, at least one int, at least one char, and at least one float.  Output is produced using these values.  Concatenation is used in the program.  
AP CSA Lite Lab 2 - Advanced Option 1 (+20 points):  The program is able to compute accurately the value of a simple arithmetic expression using the order of operations; e.g., the user could enter 5+7x2, and this  would evaluate to 19 rather than 24.
AP CSA Lite Lab 2 - Advanced Option 2 (+20 points):  The program displays interactive fiction.  This is a short story where the outcome is contingent upon the choices entered by the user.
-Primitive types
-Variables
-Assignment
-Concatenation
-Input and Output

Java Lab 3 - December:  Dice
Textbook Reading:  pp. 61-86
AP CSA Lite Lab 3 - Standard:  The program allows the user to roll two six-sided dice.  The AI also rolls two six-sided dice.  The winner gets one victory point.  The first player to earn three victory points is the Dice Champion!  At least one method with at least one parameter is defined and called in the program, and there is at least one example of sequencing, selection, and iteration.  
AP CSA Lite Lab 3 - Advanced Option 1 (+20 points):  The same requirements apply as above, but the featured game is more complex than dice, such as blackjack, mancala, or chess.
AP CSA Lite Lab 3 - Advanced Option 2 (+20 points):  The same requirements apply as above, but instead of dice, the game is a conversation with an AI.  The AI should respond to user input in a way such that someone communicating with it for thirty seconds could believe they are interacting with a real person.

Java Lab 4 - January:  Maze
Textbook Reading:  pp. 87-102 
AP CSA Lite Lab 4 - Standard:  The program generates a maze that is the same every time the program runs.  The program must include at least one class, at least one constructor, at least one class method, at least one instance variable, and at least one object.  The user can control a player and try to move the player safely from the beginning of the maze to the end of the maze.
AP CSA Lite Lab 4 - Advanced Option 1 (+20 points):  The same requirements apply as above, except the maze is generated semi-randomly.
AP CSA Lite Lab 4 - Advanced Option 2 (+20 points):  The same requirements apply as above,  and the program can chart a solution to the maze by itself.
